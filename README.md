A simple chat room plugin that allows you to talk with friends privately!<br>
This is a Spigot & Nukkit plugin!<br>

# What this plugin does
You are able to use /chatroom to create, join and quit rooms. But also to invite other players into your room!<br>
You can even use /shout to talk in the general chat as if you wern't in a room at all!<br>
